# Physics Solver

## THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY UNFINISHED

This project does not fully cover all possible cases for a suvat equation.
It covers two-three (kind of. it doesn't cover all potential equations) cases currently. I do not advise using it in its current state.  
However, if you'd like to help complete the program, any help is appreciated.

A nim program to solve SUVAT equations.

Written in Nim and licensed under the unlicense.

The code written may be imperfect or inefficient. It is a first step to getting comfortable with nim and may improve over time, but nothing is guaranteed for this project.
